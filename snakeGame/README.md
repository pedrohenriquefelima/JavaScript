The goal of this program was to practice some JQuery.

The goal is to eat those squares (food) and the snake should grow.  The game is over if:
* Snake eats its own body
* Snake hits border of the canvas

Validations:
*Snake cannot go back when the same is key is pressed twice (ex: down is pressed and down is pressed again)

There is a slightly bug on the newFoodPosition - it sometimes generates null values.
